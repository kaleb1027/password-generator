# password-generator

## Description
This project tackles a very common problem today, that being password generation. Repeating the same password on multiple sites is a bad practice and leaves you prone to hackers. This project combats that issue as its a password generator that allows you to not only create a RANDOM password, but also specify the types of characters and length that the password will have. These extra features are great due to different sites having different password requirements.
